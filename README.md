# TLSformer

TLSformer is an R package that can assist immune researchers in identifying which cells/spots belong to TLS regions or in determining the relative distance between TLS and non-TLS regions for cells/spots. It achieves this through using spatial transcriptomics data to predict single-cell RNA-seq data or other spatial transcriptomics data. TLSformer has advantages in that it does not require a large amount of training data and can perform zero-shot TLS prediction for new data from cancer types it was not directly trained on.

If you want to deep into the TLSformer you can find the manuscript in XXX and we also deposit a tutorial in the XXX.

## Getting Started

This is a mini example shows how to use TLSformer to predict TLS.

### Installing

Before you use TLSformer, you can firstly prepare a operating environment by using conda.

Using yaml file to create TLSformer operating environment

    conda env create -f tlsformer_env.yml

And after successfully creating the environment, you can find the python of this environment like in this path

    /home/xfan/miniconda3/envs/TLSformer_env/bin

This path will be the finally used python environment path
